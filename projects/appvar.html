    <h1>Application Variables!</h1>
    <p>Application variables, or AppVars, are variables that assembly programs and the TI-OS can use to store ANY kind of data!</p>
    <p>These are often used to store information that is to be used later in some shape or form.</p>
    <p>While it is easy to make them using the C(++) toolchain, sometimes you might want that an external program be used to create data that one of your programs can use.</p>
    <br/>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">This guide is here to help you do that!</p>
    <br/>
    <p>This guide is here so that there is no ambiguity on how you and your program should read and write to an AppVar file.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The following sections are provided to make your life easier:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The .8xv file</li>
      <li>The variable section content</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The .8xv file</h2>
    ".8xv" is the extension used for TI-84 variable files. The contents of this file type's header are shown here.
